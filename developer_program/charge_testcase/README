# Testcase to perform MM calculation for optimized charges and compare to QM
# 3-Fluoro-2-mercapto-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (CGenFF: 2300R6) from Figure 2
# To run use:
../developer_charge.exe charge.inp

# charge.inp contains all the settings for optimization
# charge.rel contains additional settings for optimization
